This small site was made to sell gold on Nostalrius wow server by my friend. Now its dead because of closing nostalrius.

Tomcat + java was chosen because of interesting in new programming experience, my primary specialization is php projects.
There is no actually java code because it wasn't needed in such small site. All I use different from my primary job is jstl language and xml mapping for friendly-url. 
There is some bootstrap elements I made with http://www.layoutit.com/
